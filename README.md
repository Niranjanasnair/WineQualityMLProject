# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning

This machine learning project is designed to classify wine samples based on their physicochemical attributes and predict their quality level. Using powerful algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, the model accurately assesses both red and white wine datasets. The best-performing model achieves an impressive **98% accuracy**, making it highly reliable for quality classification tasks.

Whether you're a data science enthusiast, a student, or a wine analytics researcher, this project provides a clean end-to-end pipeline—ranging from data preprocessing and exploratory analysis to robust model evaluation.


## 📊 Dataset

- [`winequality-red.csv`](winequality-red.csv)
- [`winequality-white.csv`](winequality-white.csv)

These datasets contain 11 physicochemical attributes (e.g., acidity, sugar, pH) and a quality score (0–10).
